		                        <p>Gurukul International is the best IELTS coaching institute. I had a great time here during my coaching period. The staff is very co-operative and helpful. Personal attention is given to every student. When I first joined the Institute, even though my english was fine but due to lack of confidence I was unable to get the desired band score in the mock tests due to which I felt very low sometimes but the teachers helped me built that confidence in me and because of this I was able to get the desired overall band score of 7.5 in General Training. Thank you very much Gurukul. I highly recommend it...</p>
