Visa interview is an important step prior to the final confirmation of student visa or tourist visa approval for most countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, UK and USA. Your interview could speed up or delay your visa processing. Therefore, it is crucial that you prepare for the interview and address all concerns of the visa officer. 

The interview is taken by the ambassador or visa officer who may ask you a range of questions mainly to ensure that your application case is genuine and your intentions align with what is being written in the application form. The officer is a trained professional, who could ask multiple unrelated questions, not to annoy you but to know your real interests and objectives. If you are prepared, you can enjoy this process and meeting with someone who opens the door of a new country for you.
